The sentiment analysis used in this study is the process of classifying text into two classes, namely negative and positive classes. The classification method used is Support Vector Machine (SVM). The success of the SVM method classification depends on the soft margin coefficient C, as well as the σ parameter of the kernel function. Therefore we need the right combination of SVM parameters to classify movie opinion data. This study uses the Firefly method as an SVM parameter optimization method. The dataset used in this study is public opinion data on several movies. The results of this study indicate that the Firefly Algorithm (FA) can help SVM to get the appropriate combination of parameters based on accuracy with shorter execution times. This is evidenced by the results of SVM and FA-SVM testing with a range of values C = 1.0-3.0 and σ = 0.1-1.0 resulting in the highest accuracy of 87.84%. SVM execution time is 5928 seconds, while FA-SVM takes 2330 seconds. The time difference between SVM and FA-SVM is 3598 seconds. The next test with a range of values C=1.0-3.0 and σ=1.0−20. Based on this range, the SVM method and the FA-SVM method produced the highest accuracy of 87.15%. The execution time required by the SVM method is 7205 seconds, while the time required by the FA-SVM method is 2388 seconds. The time difference between the SVM method and the FA-SVM method is 4817 seconds.
