Social media has changed the people mindset to express thoughts and moods. As the activity of social media users increases, it does not rule out the possibility of crimes of spreading hate speech can spread quickly and widely. So that it is not possible to detect hate speech manually. GRU is one of the deep learning methods that has the ability to learn information relations from the previous time to the present time. In this research feature extraction used is word2vec, because it has the ability to learn semantics between words. In this research the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) performance is compared with other supervised methods such as Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The result of experiments shows that the the combination of word2vec and GRU gives the best accuracy of 92.96%. However, the used of word2vec in the comparison methods results in the lower accuracy than the used of TF and TF-IDF features.
