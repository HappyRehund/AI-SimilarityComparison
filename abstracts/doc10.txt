Autonomous car is a vehicle that can guide itself without human intervention. Various types of rudderless vehicles are being developed. Various countries have created many future systems where computers take over the art of driving. The problem is prior to being attentive in an autonomous car for obtaining high safety. The autonomous car needs an early warning system to avoid accidents in front of the car, especially the system can be used in the Highway location. In this paper, we propose a vision-based vehicle detection system for Autonomous car. Our detection algorithm consists of three main components: HOG feature extraction, KNN classifier, and vehicle detection. Feature extraction has been used to recognize object such as cars. In this case, we use HOG feature extraction to detect as a car or non-car. We use the KNN algorithm to classify. KNN Classification in previous studies had quite good results. Car detected by matching about trining data with testing data. Trining data created by extract HOG feature from image 304 x 240 pixels. The system will produce a classification between car or non-car.
